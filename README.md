# potts

Tool to assist my documentation

## Name Origins

I started thinking of what kind of a tool I wanted and I was realizing I was describing a Personal Assistant or Secretary.

I started thinking of fictional Secretaries and landed on one of my favorites, Janine from Ghostbusters played by Annie Potts in Ghostbusters 1, 2 and the Reboot.

`potts` is way easier to type and remember than Janine or Melnitz, so I went with that.
